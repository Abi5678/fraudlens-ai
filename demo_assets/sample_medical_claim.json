  "raw_text": "MEDICAL CLAIM REVIEW - CLM-2025-FL-009821\n\nPATIENT: Robert M. Vasquez, DOB 09/22/1978, Member ID MEM-2025-88421\nPOLICY: PIP-FL-2025-44210, National Auto Casualty Insurance\nDATE OF INCIDENT: 10/12/2025\nDATE OF FIRST TREATMENT: 11/02/2025 (21 days post-incident)\nDATE CLAIM FILED: 05/15/2026 (7 months post-incident)\nTOTAL BILLED: $127,850.00\n\nINCIDENT DESCRIPTION:\nPatient reports minor rear-end motor vehicle collision in a parking lot at approximately 8 mph. No airbag deployment. No police report filed. Patient states he drove home from the scene without assistance. No emergency room visit. Patient waited 3 weeks before seeking any medical treatment, which is a significant gap between the reported minor incident and the initiation of an extensive treatment plan.\n\nCLINICAL NOTES SUMMARY:\n\n11/02/2025 - Initial Visit (Sunshine Spine & Recovery Center)\nPatient presents with complaints of neck stiffness and intermittent low back pain. Physical exam: mild tenderness to palpation over cervical paraspinals. Full range of motion in all extremities. Neurological exam normal. Assessment: cervical strain (S13.4XXA), cervicalgia (M54.2), low back pain (M54.5). Plan: MRI cervical and lumbar spine ordered, begin physical therapy 3x/week, TENS unit prescribed, labs ordered.\n\nNOTE: Documentation supports 99213 (moderate complexity) visit level. Billed as 99215 (high complexity). Clinical decision-making is straightforward for this presentation.\n\n11/04/2025 - Imaging (Coastal Imaging Center)\nMRI Cervical Spine: No acute abnormality. Mild degenerative changes C5-C6, age-appropriate.\nMRI Lumbar Spine: Mild disc bulge L4-L5. No stenosis, no nerve root compression. Age-appropriate degenerative changes.\nNOTE: MRI findings are unremarkable and inconsistent with the extensive treatment plan that follows.\n\n11/05/2025 - Cardiovascular Stress Test (Sunshine Spine)\nCardiac stress test performed. Normal results. No cardiac symptoms were documented at any visit. This test appears medically unnecessary for a neck sprain diagnosis and represents a suspicious mismatch between the diagnosis and the procedure ordered.\n\n11/10/2025 - Physical Therapy Begins\nPT evaluation billed twice on same date (97161 AND 97163) - duplicate billing. Treatment plan: manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, mechanical traction, electrical stimulation - all billed per session, 3x/week for 16 weeks. This represents an unusually intensive and prolonged treatment regimen for soft tissue injuries from a minor low-speed collision.\n\nConcurrent chiropractic treatment initiated at Tampa Bay Chiropractic Wellness on same dates as PT sessions at Sunshine Spine. Both chiropractic codes 98940 (1-2 regions) and 98941 (3-4 regions) billed on each visit - suspicious duplicate manipulation billing.\n\n12/01/2025 - Pain Management Initiated (Advanced Pain Management Associates)\nFacet joint injections begun (64493, 64494) - monthly for 6 months. No diagnostic medial branch block performed prior to therapeutic injections. No imaging confirmation of facet joint pathology. MRI showed only age-appropriate changes. Monthly pain management visits billed at 99215 (high complexity) but documentation shows brief 10-minute encounters.\n\nLABORATORY CONCERNS:\nMonthly CBC (85025), Basic Metabolic Panel (80048), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (80053), and TSH (84443) ordered throughout treatment. Basic and comprehensive metabolic panels billed on same dates - clear unbundling. No clinical indication for repeated blood work or thyroid testing for a soft tissue injury. TSH testing for a neck sprain patient with no thyroid symptoms is medically unjustified.\n\nMEDICATION CONCERNS:\nOxycodone 10mg TID prescribed for 16 weeks for soft tissue injury from a minor collision. This is inconsistent with standard treatment guidelines which recommend NSAIDs and conservative therapy. Extended opioid prescription for a low-speed MVA whiplash injury raises significant concerns.\n\nMULTIPLE PROVIDER OVERLAP:\nThree separate providers billing for overlapping services on same dates:\n- Sunshine Spine & Recovery Center: PT, injections, labs, supplies\n- Tampa Bay Chiropractic Wellness: Chiropractic adjustments (same dates as PT)\n- Advanced Pain Management Associates: Facet injections, office visits\n\nAll three providers are located within a 2-mile radius and share the same referring physician (Dr. Elena Ruiz, NPI 1234509876). This pattern is consistent with coordinated provider networks commonly associated with medical fraud mills.\n\nSUPPLY CHARGES:\n$4,800 in supply charges (99070) over 16 weeks with no itemization. Standard practice requires itemized supply documentation.\n\nDISABILITY EVALUATIONS:\nThree work disability evaluations billed (99455) for a patient who is self-employed with no documented employer and no workers compensation claim on file. Medical necessity for disability evaluations is questionable.\n\nSUMMARY OF CONCERNS:\n1. Significant 3-week delay between minor incident and first treatment\n2. Extensive 16-week treatment plan for minor soft tissue injuries from 8 mph collision\n3. MRI findings do not support the intensity of treatment provided\n4. Cardiac stress test with no cardiac symptoms - diagnosis-procedure mismatch\n5. Duplicate PT evaluations billed same day\n6. Duplicate chiropractic manipulation codes billed same visits\n7. Lab unbundling - basic and comprehensive metabolic panels on same dates\n8. Medically unnecessary labs (TSH for neck sprain)\n9. 99215 upcoding - documentation supports lower visit levels\n10.

SCENE 1 (0:00–0:15) — Hook
---
Insurance fraud costs the industry 308 billion dollars annually. Investigations take 60 plus days per claim. FraudLens AI uses NVIDIA's full AI stack to analyze claims in under 5 minutes — detecting not just individual fraud, but organized fraud rings.

---
SCENE 2 (0:15–0:35) — Architecture
---
FraudLens AI is a multi-agent system built entirely on NVIDIA technology:

Nemotron-Parse extracts structured data from any document.
NVIDIA NIM powers 7 specialized AI agents running in parallel.
NeMo Retriever matches claims against known fraud patterns using RAG.
cuGraph detects fraud rings through GPU-accelerated graph analytics.
Milvus stores and searches fraud pattern embeddings.

---
SCENE 3 (0:35–0:55) — Live demo
---
Let me walk through a live analysis. Here's a suspicious auto insurance claim — a hit-and-run with no witnesses, no police report, and 47,500 dollars in soft-tissue injury claims.

---
SCENE 4 (0:55–1:30) — Results
---
In under a minute, our agents return a comprehensive analysis.

A score out of 100 — with a clear risk level.
The weighted scoring breaks down each risk dimension.
The inconsistency agent found several red flags: claim filed 2 weeks after incident, medical treatment delayed 5 days, claim amount at 95 percent of coverage limit.
NeMo Retriever matched this against staged accident and inflated claim patterns.
The network agent checked for fraud ring connections.
And here's the AI-generated investigative report — ready for an adjuster to review.

---
SCENE 5 (1:30–1:50) — Differentiators
---
What makes FraudLens AI unique:

7 specialized agents working in parallel — not a single prompt.
RAG-powered pattern matching with NeMo Retriever embeddings and reranking.
Graph-based fraud ring detection — because fraud is organized, not isolated.
Explainable AI — every score comes with evidence and reasoning.
61 passing tests covering all agents end-to-end.

---
SCENE 6 (1:50–2:00) — Impact and close
---
For a mid-size insurer processing 50,000 claims per year:
Investigation time: 60 days down to 5 minutes.
Cost per investigation: 500 dollars down to 10 cents.
Projected savings: 45 million dollars annually.

FraudLens AI — detecting fraud in minutes, not months. Built 100 percent on NVIDIA.
